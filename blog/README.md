# Exercise

This exercise does not require implementation.
Simpy try to come up with a good RESTful interface and discuss with your colleagues.

We want to implement a simple blog. We want our application to
be able to do the following:

## content management
- add a blog post (only for authorized users)
- delete a blog post (only for authorized users)
- fetch a blog post
- fetch the last 10 posts
- specify one or more categories for each blog post
- fetch the last 10 posts for each blog post
- get the most popular posts
- allow specifying a nice user-friendly url for fetching a blog post
- update a blog post (only for authorized users)

## authentication & user management
- log in
- log out
- add, update and delete a user

Please list the URL endpoints and HTTP methods you would implement, document what each call does, and what the request and response looks like (describe status code, important headers, body, ...)
